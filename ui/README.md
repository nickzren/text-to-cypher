## 🚀 Initial Setup

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**

From the `ui` directory, run:

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 2: ▶️ Running the Application**

From the root directory, run both frontend and backend:
```bash
./scripts/run-dev.sh
```

Or run them separately:
- Frontend only (from `ui` directory): `npm run dev`
- Backend only (from root): `uv run uvicorn src.api_server:app --reload`
